## Step 1

![Step 1](output\screenshots\step_0_20241229_193229.png)

This screenshot shows the main interface of a screen recording application, ScreenDoc.  The application is in a "ready to record" state.  The "Record" button is highlighted in the navigation menu. Recording settings (quality at 80 and FPS at 30) are configured.  A large green checkmark indicates the readiness of the application.  The "Start Recording" button is prominently displayed, awaiting user action to begin the recording.

## Step 2

![Step 2](output\screenshots\step_1_20241229_193229.png)

The user initiated a screen recording.  The "Start Recording" button is gone, replaced by a "Recording in progress..." message. A small green bar also appeared under the large checkmark.

## Step 3

![Step 3](output\screenshots\step_2_20241229_193231.png)

The user stopped the ScreenDoc recording.  The recording controls and the "Recording in progress..." message have disappeared from the left sidebar, and the main recording area is now a blank black screen.

## Step 4

![Step 4](output\screenshots\step_3_20241229_193232.png)

The user performed a Google search.  The first screenshot shows a blank Google Chrome tab; the second shows the results page for a search query (likely related to weather, judging by the prominent weather information displayed).  The address bar now displays "https://www.google.com".

## Step 5

![Step 5](output\screenshots\step_4_20241229_193234.png)

The user typed "me" into the Google search bar and initiated a search.  The resulting Google search autocomplete suggestions and results are now displayed below the search bar.

## Step 6

![Step 6](output\screenshots\step_5_20241229_193237.png)

The user selected the search query "meteo paris 31 dec" from the Google search suggestions and pressed Enter.  The search results page now displays in the browser.

## Step 7

![Step 7](output\screenshots\step_6_20241229_193241.png)

The user closed the Google Chrome browser and opened a file explorer window showing a folder named "recordings" containing video files.  The action was switching applications.

## Step 8

![Step 8](output\screenshots\step_7_20241229_193242.png)

The user opened the "recordings" folder.  The second screenshot shows the contents of the folder, listing several files and subfolders, which were not visible in the first screenshot.

## Step 9

![Step 9](output\screenshots\step_8_20241229_193245.png)

The user opened the "ScreenDoc" folder.  The file listing within the folder is now replaced with the message "Travail en cours...", indicating that the folder's contents are currently being processed or loaded.

## Step 10

![Step 10](output\screenshots\step_9_20241229_193247.png)

The user navigated into the `output` folder.  The file explorer's contents changed to display the files and folders within the `output` directory, showing `docs`, `recordings`, `screenshots`, and `data_meteo`.

## Step 11

![Step 11](output\screenshots\step_10_20241229_193248.png)

The user double-clicked the `data_meteo.txt` file in a file explorer window.  This opened the file in a text editor, displaying its contents.

## Step 12

![Step 12](output\screenshots\step_11_20241229_193250.png)

The user opened the `output` folder in File Explorer.  This is evident from the appearance of the folder's contents (files and subfolders) in the right-hand panel of the File Explorer window.

## Step 13

![Step 13](output\screenshots\step_12_20241229_193252.png)

The user stopped recording a ScreenDoc session.  The first screenshot shows a file explorer window with a "data meteo.txt" file selected. The second shows the ScreenDoc application's recording interface, displaying a "Recording in progress..." message which is now absent, indicating the recording has been stopped.  The ScreenDoc main window is now visible, showing recording settings and a confirmation checkmark.

## Step 14

![Step 14](output\screenshots\step_13_20241229_193253.png)

The user adjusted the FPS setting in the ScreenDoc recording settings from 32 to 30.  No other significant changes occurred.
