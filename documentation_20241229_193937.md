## Step 1

![Step 1](output\screenshots\step_2_20241229_193708.png)

The screenshot shows a Chrome browser window with a dark theme.  The address bar contains a search query, but the main browser content area is completely blank, indicating a page is loading or has failed to load.  The bookmarks bar displays several bookmarked websites, including YouTube, Databricks, LinkedIn, and others.  The system time and date are visible in the lower right corner. This step in the workflow represents a point where a webpage is being accessed but hasn't yet fully rendered.

## Step 2

![Step 2](output\screenshots\step_3_20241229_193709.png)

The user performed a Google search.  The initial screenshot shows a blank Google Chrome browser window.  The second screenshot shows the results page for a Google search, displaying various search results, including news articles and links to websites like GitHub and DataCamp.

## Step 3

![Step 3](output\screenshots\step_5_20241229_193716.png)

The user performed a Google search.  The previous screenshot shows various browser tabs and windows. The current screenshot shows a new Google search tab with the query "meteo paris 31 december" entered in the search bar.

## Step 4

![Step 4](output\screenshots\step_6_20241229_193722.png)

The user submitted a search query "meteo paris 31 décembre" into the Google search bar and pressed Enter (or clicked the magnifying glass icon).  The result is the display of weather information for Paris on December 31st, including a suggested correction of the query, temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind information, and a weather forecast graph.

## Step 5

![Step 5](output\screenshots\step_7_20241229_193723.png)

The user switched from a Google search showing weather information for "meteo paris 31 décembre" to a file explorer window showing the contents of a folder named "output", likely to save the screenshot of the weather information.

## Step 6

![Step 6](output\screenshots\step_8_20241229_193725.png)

The user selected the "screenshots" folder in the file explorer.  No other significant changes are visible.

## Step 7

![Step 7](output\screenshots\step_9_20241229_193727.png)

The user double-clicked the `data meteo.txt` file in the file explorer (image 1).  This opened the file in a text editor (image 2), displaying its contents.

## Step 8

![Step 8](output\screenshots\step_10_20241229_193730.png)

The user added several lines of text to the `data_meteo.txt` file.  Specifically, they added  "Choose area", "Cloudy", and "Temperature/Precipitation/wind" as well as some data seemingly related to file modification times and types.  Additionally, a notification popped up suggesting the installation of the Docker extension from Microsoft.

## Step 9

![Step 9](output\screenshots\step_11_20241229_193732.png)

The user stopped a screen recording.  The first image shows a file explorer and code editor; the second image shows a screen recording application interface displaying a "Recording in progress..." message that has now changed to show that the recording has stopped.  The action taken was initiating and then completing a screen recording session.
