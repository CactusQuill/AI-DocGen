## Step 1

![Step 1](output\screenshots\step_0_20241229_182200.png)

This screenshot shows a command prompt window displaying the output of a Python script. The script is generating documentation, but encounters repeated errors (16 times) indicating that the "Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision" model is deprecated and suggests switching to a different model.  The script successfully generates a documentation file ("documentation_20241229_181615.md") despite the errors.  A warning message about log messages written to STDERR and a timeout are also present.  The script's execution path is shown, indicating it's running from a user's Desktop.  Finally, a "Starting screen recording" message shows the script is also recording its activity.

## Step 2

The workflow progressed through several more processing steps.  The log now shows additional "Processing step [number]...flash" entries and corresponding deprecation warnings for "404 Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision".  No user interaction is apparent; the change reflects the internal progress of an automated process.

## Step 3

![Step 3](output\screenshots\step_2_20241229_182201.png)

The user stopped a command-line process (likely a screen recording) and opened a Google Chrome browser window, navigating to the Google search page.

## Step 4

![Step 4](output\screenshots\step_3_20241229_182204.png)

The user typed a search query ("ai studio google") into the Google search bar.  The Google search autocomplete feature then populated the search bar with suggestions based on the typed text.

## Step 5

![Step 5](output\screenshots\step_4_20241229_182208.png)

The user selected the first search suggestion "ai google studio" from the Google search autocomplete dropdown.  This resulted in the search term being entered into the search bar and the autocomplete dropdown disappearing.

## Step 6

![Step 6](output\screenshots\step_5_20241229_182211.png)

The user searched "ai google studio" in Google Search.  The resulting search led them to the Google AI Studio website, which is now displayed.

## Step 7

![Step 7](output\screenshots\step_6_20241229_182213.png)

The user clicked the "Get API key" button.  This resulted in the display of the API keys section, showing instructions and a code example for quickly testing the Gemini API.

## Step 8

![Step 8](output\screenshots\step_7_20241229_182220.png)

The user clicked the "Get API key" button.  This resulted in the display changing from showing instructions on how to obtain an API key via a cURL command to displaying a table of existing API keys, along with options to create a new API key ("Create API key" button is now visible).

## Step 9

![Step 9](output\screenshots\step_8_20241229_182223.png)

A new API key was generated.  The "Create API key" button was clicked, resulting in a modal popup displaying the newly generated key (partially obscured for security) with a "Copy" button and an updated "Plan" status from "Free of charge" to "Paid".

## Step 10

![Step 10](output\screenshots\step_9_20241229_182225.png)

The user clicked the "Copy" button in the "API key generated" modal.  The button's text changed from "Copy" to "Copied to clipboard," indicating the API key was successfully copied.

## Step 11

![Step 11](output\screenshots\step_10_20241229_182226.png)

The user clicked the "Copy" button in the "API key generated" dialog box.  The text "Copied to clipboard" now appears below the API key, indicating the key has been copied to the system clipboard.

## Step 12

![Step 12](output\screenshots\step_11_20241229_182228.png)

The user copied the API key.  The second screenshot shows a blank screen, indicating the Google AI Studio page was closed or minimized after the "Copy" button, within the "API key generated" modal, was clicked.

## Step 13

![Step 13](output\screenshots\step_12_20241229_182229.png)

A new text editor window opened, displaying a "Save As" dialog box.  The user is saving a file named `save_api.txt` to the Desktop.  The file path and a seemingly randomly generated string are visible in the dialog.  The Restricted Mode warning is present.

## Step 14

![Step 14](output\screenshots\step_13_20241229_182236.png)

The user closed the Notepad application containing the file "save_api.txt".  The workflow then shows the Windows desktop.

## Step 15

![Step 15](output\screenshots\step_14_20241229_182238.png)

A command prompt window appeared, displaying multiple error messages indicating that "404 Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision has been deprecated on July 12, 2024."  The errors relate to various processing steps within a workflow.  Additionally, the console shows log messages and indicates the start of a screen recording.
